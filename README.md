# CNN_Helmet_Pred
This CNN model detects helmets in images using six convolutional layers with batch normalization and max pooling, followed by dense layers with Elastic Net regularization and dropout. It processes 64x64 RGB images and outputs a binary prediction (helmet or no helmet). Data augmentation and optional bounding box cropping improve training robustness.
